# Flavour Bistro

## Purpose

Flavour Bistro is a fictional restaurant project created to demonstrate and teach Django concepts in a practical way.

The project is not intended as a production-ready restaurant website, but rather as an educational example that helps learners understand:

* How to set up and configure a Django project.
* How to create apps, models, views, and templates.
* How to work with forms, authentication, and static/media files.
* How to structure a project using best practices.
* How a real-world use case (a restaurant site with menus, reservations, and opening times) can be implemented in Django.
